# Sales Prediction Using Python
## Project Synopsis
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to forecast the Car Purchase Amount. The purpose of the dataset is to develop a model that can predict a customer's car purchase price with a high degree of accuracy. It includes information such as consumer demographics.

## Actions Required
1. Inspection and loading of data
File name: car_purchasing.csv.

Task: In order to comprehend the features and goal variable, load the dataset and examine its structure.

Objective : Learn enough about the data to inform the preprocessing and modeling processes that come after.

2. Preprocessing and Data Exploration Tasks:

Analyzing exploratory data (EDA): Utilizing summary statistics and visualizations, investigate the connections between the target variable and the characteristics.

Managing Missing Values: Look for and take care of any data that is missing.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Whenever necessary, transform any categorical data into a numerical representation.

Feature scaling: To guarantee that each feature contributes equally to the model, normalize or standardize the data.

Objective: Make sure the data is clean and formatted correctly in order to prepare it for model training.

3. Feature Selection and Engineering Task: Determine and pick pertinent features that will probably have an impact on the Car Purchase Amount. If necessary, carry out feature engineering to provide new features that might raise the predictive capacity of the model.

Objective: Enhance model performance and accuracy by optimizing the input features.

4. Data Splitting Task: Using an 80/20 or 70/30 ratio, divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

Objective: To make sure the model generalizes effectively to new data, train it on a subset of data (the training set) and assess its performance on a different subset (the testing set).

5. Model-Building Activities:
Model Selection: Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are two examples of more complicated models that can be introduced gradually from a basic model like linear regression.
Getting the Model Ready: Using the training data, train the chosen model or models.

Objective: Using the input features, develop a predictive model that can reliably estimate the quantity of cars that will be purchased.

6. Model Evaluation 
Metrics for Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using measures like R^2 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Model Comparison: To determine which model performs the best, compare the capabilities of several models.

Objective: Evaluate each model's ability to forecast the target variable and select the most successful one.

7. Model Optimization 
Task: Adjust the hyperparameters of the model to increase accuracy. This could entail grid search, cross-validation, or other optimization methods.
Objective: Determine the ideal parameters to improve the model's performance.

8. Predictions and Business Insights

Task : Apply the learned model to forecast previously unobserved or new data.

Objective: Offer useful information that companies may use to improve their marketing tactics and increase revenue.

9. Explanation and Conclusion

Task: Record every step of the procedure, including the outcomes and important learnings.

Objective: Produce an extensive documentation of the project that is simple for others to comprehend and duplicate.
Files in the Repository:  sales.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook with all of the code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
car_purchasing.csv: The dataset used in this project;
README.md: A thorough description of the project that includes instructions on how to run the code and a list of the tasks involved.
## How the Project Should Be Operated

Make a local copy of the repository on your computer.
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open sales.ipynb.
To replicate the steps of data analysis, model training, and evaluation, run the cells one after the other.
## Future Tasks
Extra Elements: Investigate other features or datasets that might improve the performance of the model.
Advanced Models: Use more intricate models, such as neural networks or XGBoost.
Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting the hyperparameters will help the model be even more optimized.
